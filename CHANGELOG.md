# 0.2.0

Mostly I've been working on improving the `diff` program.

1. `diff` now shows the values as well
2. `diff` now has `--silent` (or `-s`) flag to get rid of all formatting
3. `diff` now exits with code `1` when files are different
4. `diff` now does not output anything when files are the same

Also I've added an installation script for you.
